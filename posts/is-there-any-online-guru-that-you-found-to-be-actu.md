The world of **online gurus**—those self-proclaimed experts who promise massive success through courses, coaching, or digital products—is vast and, frankly, a mixed bag. Many online gurus offer flashy marketing and lofty promises, but few deliver **consistent value** that justifies their often high price tags. So the question stands: *Are there any online gurus who are actually good?*

## What Makes an Online Guru Actually Good?

Before naming examples, it’s crucial to understand what *good* means in this context. A genuinely good online guru typically demonstrates:

- **Proven track record:** Real success stories with verifiable results.
- **Transparency:** Clear, honest communication about what their training involves and the realistic outcomes.
- **Actionable content:** Practical advice that can be applied immediately.
- **Respect for the audience:** No aggressive upsells or hype-driven gimmicks.
- **Community and support:** Access to a helpful network of learners or mentorship.

## Examples of Online Gurus That Are Actually Good

While many fall short, a select few creators stand out in the crowded online space. Here are some well-regarded figures:

1. **Pat Flynn**  
   Known for his transparency and authenticity, Pat Flynn has built his brand around *smart passive income*. His podcasts, blog, and courses deliver actionable advice without the usual hype.
