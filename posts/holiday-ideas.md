![Holiday Extravaganza: 9 Jolly Ideas for Making Money Online This Season](/media/holiday-exatravaganza.webp)

Ah, the holidays — a time of joy, peppermint lattes, and… entrepreneurial spirit?

Whether you're snowed in or just vibing under palm trees wrapped in string lights, the festive season is the *perfect* excuse to get creative and earn a little extra cash. Let’s make this holiday season not just merry, but profitable.

Here are 9 **holiday ideas for making money online** — no sleigh required.



## 1. Sell Holiday-Themed Printables on Etsy

Think gift tags, holiday planners, party invites, or Christmas scavenger hunts.
All you need is [Canva](https://www.canva.com/) and a sprinkle of creativity.

> *Bonus tip:* Create a “Holiday Party Bundle” to upsell and increase cart value.



## 2. Launch a Festive Dropshipping Store

Ugly sweaters. Elf hats. Tree-shaped baking molds. Dropshipping lets you sell without inventory.
Use a service like [Spocket](https://spocket.co/) or [Zendrop](https://www.zendrop.com/) to source holiday goods and build a quick Shopify store.

> Just make sure to highlight “Fast Shipping” — no one wants their stocking stuffers arriving in January.



## 3. Run a Virtual Holiday Trivia Night

If you're charismatic and know your “Home Alone” from your “Elf,” host a paid Zoom trivia night.
Use [Eventbrite](https://www.eventbrite.com/) to charge admission and promote it on social media.

> It’s like a Christmas party, minus the awkward mistletoe moments.


## 4. Offer Holiday-Themed Copywriting or Design Services

Freelancers can offer special “Holiday Package” gigs on [Fiverr](https://www.fiverr.com/) or [Upwork](https://www.upwork.com/).
Think email sequences for ecommerce stores, festive social media posts, or New Year rebrands.



## 5. Sell Holiday Recipes as a Mini eBook

Got a killer snickerdoodle or gingerbread cheesecake recipe?
Whip up a PDF in Google Docs, export as a fancy eBook, and sell it on [Gumroad](https://gumroad.com/).

## Intermission: 7 Absolutely Awful Gift Ideas (Please, No)

Before you go spreading holiday cheer, let’s take a moment to remember: not all gifts are created equal.  
Here are 7 legendary misfires you should *not* sell, give, or receive unless you want to be remembered… for all the wrong reasons:

1. **A personalized diet plan** – Nothing says “Happy Holidays” like a passive-aggressive body critique.
2. **Socks with your own face on them** – Bold. Terrifying. Unforgettable. But mostly terrifying.
3. **A DVD box set of a show that’s still streaming** – A modern twist on useless media.
4. **Expired holiday candles from last year** – Smells like cinnamon… and neglect.
5. **A "live, laugh, love" sign** – For when you truly gave up trying.
6. **A DIY taxidermy kit** – Fun for no one. Especially not the raccoon.
7. **An NFT of a snowflake** – It’s unique. It’s worthless. It’s... winter Web3.

## 6. Start a “Holiday Hustles” Podcast or YouTube Channel

Film yourself trying holiday side gigs like wrapping gifts for people, flipping holiday decor, or testing the best Christmas cocktail recipes to sell at parties.

> 🎧 *Episode 143: Holiday Extravaganza — Side Hustle Edition?*
> Yeah, you see where this is going.



## 7. Curate Affiliate Gift Guides

Write a blog post (like this one!) that features affiliate links to Amazon, Target, or niche brands.
Holiday gift guides are *search magnets* during Q4.

* [Amazon Associates](https://affiliate-program.amazon.com/)
* [ShareASale](https://www.shareasale.com/)
* [LTK](https://company.shopltk.com/)


## 8. Sell Holiday Stock Photos or Reels

If you’ve got an eye for aesthetic — photograph ornaments, trees, holiday mugs, or cozy home setups and sell on:

* [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/)
* [Shutterstock](https://submit.shutterstock.com/)
* [Creative Market](https://creativemarket.com/)

> Or post festive B-roll on [TikTok Creative Exchange](https://ads.tiktok.com/business/creativecenter/creatorexchange/).



## 9. Offer a “Holiday Inbox Detox” Service

People are overwhelmed with holiday sales emails.
If you’re an organization geek, offer to clean up Gmail inboxes or manage online returns as a VA (Virtual Assistant).

> Market it as “Santa’s Personal Assistant… but make it digital.”


## Wrap It Up: This Season, Deck the Halls *and* Your Wallet

You don’t need to open a toy factory or work the North Pole night shift to boost your income.
From printables to party games, there’s a **festive goldmine online** for anyone willing to get a little creative.

So put on that ugly sweater, cue up some Mariah Carey, and let this holiday season be your most profitable yet.
