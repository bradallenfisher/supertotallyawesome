When discussing a company's strategic foundation, **brand purpose**, **mission**, and **vision** are often mentioned—but they are not the same. Understanding their differences is essential for building a coherent, impactful brand.

### What Is Brand Purpose?

**Brand purpose** is the *fundamental reason a brand exists beyond making money*. It reflects the higher social or emotional value a brand aims to create for its customers and society at large. Often rooted in **authenticity and positive impact**, the brand purpose connects employees and customers through shared beliefs and values.

For example, a brand purpose might be:  
*“To empower people to live healthier, happier lives.”*

### How Does Brand Purpose Differ from Mission?

- The **mission** describes *what the company does every day* to achieve its purpose. It’s action-oriented and focuses on the company's operations, goals, and target market. 
- While brand purpose answers **why** a brand exists, mission answers **what** it does.

Example:  
- **Brand Purpose:** Create sustainable livelihoods.  
- **Mission:** Produce and sell eco-friendly household products.

### How Is Vision Different?

- The **vision** is a *future-oriented aspiration* describing where the company wants to be in the long term. It serves as a guiding star for strategic decisions.
- Vision is often inspirational and paints a picture of the desired impact or status.

Example:  
- Vision: *“To be the world leader in sustainable living solutions.”*
