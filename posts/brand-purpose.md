## What Is Brand Purpose?

Brand purpose is the *reason your brand exists beyond making money*. It reflects the *impact your brand wants to have on customers and society*. A strong brand purpose goes beyond products or services—it’s about meaningful change and *building trust* with your audience.

## Why Brand Purpose Is Important in Today’s Marketplace

In today’s crowded market, people want to connect with brands that share their values. A clear brand purpose helps you *stand out, create loyalty*, and *build emotional connections* with customers.

From there, build a brand vision that describes the future your brand wants to create. This vision acts as a roadmap for your strategies and goals.

## Purpose Statement vs Mission Statement: Understanding the Difference

A *purpose statement* explains *why* your brand exists at its core. A *mission statement* focuses on *what your brand does* to achieve its purpose.
