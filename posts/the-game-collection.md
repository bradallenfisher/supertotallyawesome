![90s Games & How to Revive Them as a Nostalgia-Based Business](/media/game-collection.webp)

### 1. **Crossfire (Board Game)**

> 🎯 *“You’ll get caught up in the Crossfire!”*

**Revival Idea:**
Turn this kinetic shooter game into a mobile e-sports-style app with PvP mode and retro 90s synth graphics. Sell branded “desktop Crossfire” kits for offices as stress relievers.



### 2. **Pogs & Slammers**

> 🟡 *Milk caps were basically cardboard cryptocurrency.*

**Revival Idea:**
Launch an NFT-based Pog-style collection where slammers are limited edition collectibles. Or, create customizable real-life Pog kits for parties, bachelor nights, or schools.



### 3. **Skip-It (Outdoor Toy)**

> 🦵 *“The very best thing of all — there’s a counter on this ball!”*

**Revival Idea:**
Modernize it with step counters and LED lights — sell it as a TikTok challenge toy or fitness nostalgia collectible. Collaborate with influencers for “Skip-It Throwback” dance routines.



### 4. **Oregon Trail (Video Game)**

> ☠️ *You have died of dysentery.*

**Revival Idea:**
Create a meme-heavy browser game version with Gen Z commentary or launch a physical card game version with absurd events, like “Your influencer wagon lost Wi-Fi.”



### 5. **Dream Phone (Board Game)**

> 📞 *“He looks great in whatever he wears… and he’s not wearing socks!”*

**Revival Idea:**
Make an ironic dating sim app or Twitch stream version where players try to guess their mystery date based on absurd, over-the-top clues. Market it as “pre-Tinder chaos.”



### 6. **NBA Jam (Video Game)**

> 🔥 *“He’s on fire!”*

**Revival Idea:**
Remaster it as a retro pixel-style mobile game with streetball influencers. Add NFTs for custom courts and characters. Sell 90s-style jerseys as merch.



### 7. **Mousetrap (Board Game)**

> 🧀 *Build the trap. Don’t question the chaos.*

**Revival Idea:**
Make a real-life escape room challenge inspired by the Rube Goldberg chain reactions. You could also launch a YouTube engineering series recreating absurd mousetrap mechanics IRL.



### 8. **Tamagotchi**

> 🐣 *Feed it. Clean it. Love it. Cry when it dies.*

**Revival Idea:**
Release a retro-themed mobile Tamagotchi app or wearable, branded with throwback pixel art. Or, offer adult “productivity pets” that you care for by completing daily habits.



### 9. **Manhunt (Outdoor Game)**

> 🏃 *Hide and seek's terrifying older cousin.*

**Revival Idea:**
Host nostalgia-themed adult night events in city parks or campgrounds — think “Glowstick Manhunt.” Build a mobile app that connects players for large-scale IRL games.



### 10. **GoldenEye 007 (N64 Video Game)**

> 🔫 *“No Oddjob.” – every friend group rule.*

**Revival Idea:**
Remaster as a browser multiplayer FPS with 90s skins and soundtrack. Pair it with limited-edition controllers and an online tournament series for OG fans.



### 11. **Don’t Wake Daddy (Board Game)**

> 🛏️ *Sneak to the fridge or face the wrath.*

**Revival Idea:**
Create a suspense-based mobile game with cartoon horror elements. Or market it as a drinking game re-release with adult humor and new themes like “Don’t Wake Your Boss.”



### 12. **Red Rover (Outdoor Game)**

> 🧍🧍🧍 “Red Rover, Red Rover…”

**Revival Idea:**
Revive it as a kid-safe, padded version for youth fitness programs or summer camps. Could also be sold as a team-building icebreaker kit with instructional cards.



### 13. **Mortal Kombat (Arcade Game)**

> 🩸 *Finish him!*

**Revival Idea:**
Merge retro aesthetics with AR filters and let users record “fatality-style” TikToks. Or create an ironic clothing line with pixelated gore and catchphrases.



### 14. **Girl Talk (Board Game)**

> 💋 *Spin the wheel, spill the tea.*

**Revival Idea:**
Make a podcast around re-reading old 90s girl game cards as adults. Sell physical nostalgia decks for parties, bridal showers, or TikTok "Truth or Dare" content packs.



### 15. **Bop It**

> 🔊 *Twist it! Pull it! Bop it! Fail dramatically!*

**Revival Idea:**
Create a “rage mode” version as a phone app or smart speaker skill. Or revive it as a party game with sabotage settings and streamer reaction challenges.
