![And Why Are There So Many of Them, All Making the Same Claims, All Using the Same Sales Tactics, and All Charging the Same Prices?](/media/and-why-are-there-so-many-of-them-all-making-the-same-claims-all-using-the-same-sales-tactics-and-all-charging-the-same-prices.jpg)

The internet is flooded with countless **make money online gurus**, coaches, and courses, all promising to deliver life-changing results. Despite the abundance of options, they often share striking similarities: identical claims of quick wealth, repetitive sales tactics, and surprisingly uniform pricing. But why is this the case?

### 1. The Proven Formula of Success (or Perceived Success)

Most online gurus follow a **tried-and-true blueprint**. This formula involves bold promises such as "earn $10,000 in 30 days," "work from anywhere," and "financial freedom with zero experience." These claims work because they tap into deep-seated desires and are easy to market. The repetition across countless programs emphasizes that this formula **has been successful for some**, even if the majority don’t see the promised results.

### 2. Sales Tactics are Standardized and Tested

The sales approach commonly involves:

- **Limited-time offers** to create urgency.
- **Free webinars or masterclasses** that upsell the main product.
- **Testimonials and social proof** to build trust.
- **Money-back guarantees** to reduce buyer hesitation.

These tactics have been **extensively tested** in the digital marketing space and yield predictable conversion rates. Reusing these proven strategies reduces risk for sellers and makes scaling easier.

### 3. Price Points Reflect Market Psychology and Competition

Most courses charge between **$997 to $2997** because:

- This price range is **high enough to signal value** but still attainable.
- It aligns with standard marketing research showing **maximum conversion at these price points**.
- Pricing in this bracket means gurus can afford substantial ad spend on platforms like Facebook and Google.
- Underpricing risks devaluing the product, while overpricing narrows the audience.

The similarity in pricing results from a balance of **perceived value**, **market standards**, and **ad budget constraints**.

### 4. A Saturated, Copycat Market

As successful gurus earn millions, numerous newcomers attempt the model themselves, often borrowing the language, style, and pricing strategy. This creates a **cycle of imitation**:

- Newcomers craft courses that look and sound **similar to existing ones**.
- They employ the **same marketing playbook** because it’s seen as the fastest path to success.
- Result? Thousands of nearly identical offers competing for attention.

### 5. The Illusion of Diversity Masks a Lack of Real Innovation

While the surface promises vary slightly (affiliate marketing, dropshipping, freelancing), the **core value propositions are largely the same**: sell a digital product, recruit others, or leverage paid ads to drive traffic. This limits true differentiation, making many offers interchangeable.

**In conclusion,** the ubiquity of online gurus making the same claims, using the same sales tactics, and charging similar prices is no accident. It results from a combination of proven formulas, tested marketing techniques, psychological pricing strategies, and a saturated, copycat-driven market. Buyers should approach these offers with a critical eye, research carefully, and seek authentic value rather than hype.
