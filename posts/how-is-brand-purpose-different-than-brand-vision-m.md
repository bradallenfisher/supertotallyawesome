Understanding the distinctions between **brand purpose**, **brand vision**, **mission**, and **values** is essential for building a strong and authentic brand identity. These foundational elements guide a company’s strategy and communication but serve unique roles that, when clearly defined, create alignment both internally and externally.

## What is Brand Purpose?

**Brand purpose** is the *fundamental reason a brand exists beyond making money*. It reflects the positive impact the brand aims to have on society, customers, or the world at large. The purpose answers the question:  
*“Why do we do what we do?”*

Unlike vision or mission statements, brand purpose is deeply emotional and inspirational. It connects with the audience on a deeper level by focusing on meaningful change or contribution.
