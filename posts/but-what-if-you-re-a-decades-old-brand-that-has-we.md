Many brands that have been around for decades rely heavily on **established attributes** such as product quality, customer loyalty, or visual identity. However, the **lack of a clear brand purpose**—a deeper, guiding reason for the brand’s existence beyond profits—can limit a company’s ability to connect emotionally with modern consumers and adapt to evolving markets.

### Why is Brand Purpose Important for Established Brands?

A **brand purpose** is the meaningful, authentic “why” behind everything a company does. For new brands, it can be built from the ground up; but for legacy brands, priorities often focused on performance metrics rather than a holistic purpose. Still, purpose brings:

- **Emotional connection:** Customers today want to support brands that stand for something meaningful.
- **Long-term resilience:** Purpose-driven brands navigate market shifts with agility.
- **Employee engagement:** Purpose energizes internal culture and attracts talent.
- **Differentiation:** Amid commoditization, purpose separates a brand from competitors.

### Steps to Define or Uncover Your Brand Purpose

1. **Assess Your Brand’s History and Impact:** Review how your brand’s longstanding activities, values, and contributions have affected customers, employees, and communities.
2. **Engage Internal and External Stakeholders:** Get input from employees, loyal customers, and partners to reflect on what the brand means today and what it aspires to be.
3. **Identify Core Values and Beliefs:** Determine the underlying principles that have guided your brand’s decisions and culture.
4. **Link Purpose to Present and Future Relevance:** Frame your brand purpose to resonate with current societal or customer needs, while aligning with your legacy.
5. **Communicate Authentic Stories:** Use storytelling to illustrate the brand’s purpose through real examples and initiatives, reinforcing credibility.
6. **Integrate Purpose Across Touchpoints:** Reflect your brand purpose consistently in marketing, product development, corporate social responsibility, and employee programs.

### Challenges and How to Overcome Them

- **Resistance to change:** Established brands may fear diluting their heritage. Overcoming this requires leadership commitment and transparent communication.
- **Vagueness or overgeneralization:** Avoid generic mission statements that don’t inspire or differentiate.
- **Implementation gaps:** Ensure short-term actions align with long-term purpose to build trust.

### Example

A classic automotive brand, with a rich heritage of craftsmanship, may discover its brand purpose revolves around **“driving sustainable innovation for future generations,”** seamlessly connecting its historical values to today’s environmental concerns.
